This document provides you with the commonly used steps to migrate from pChart to mtChart.

= Common steps =
  # Remove all pChart-includes and just include mtChart.php: `include('mtChart/mtChart.php');`
  # Replace the two instanciation commands for pData and pChart with the one for mtChart only: `$Graph = new mtChart($width, $height);`
  # Replace all references to the former pData object with references to the mtChart object. I.e. `$Graph->addPoint($value, 'Serie1');`
  # Remove all calls to the methods `getData()` and `getDataDescription()`. I.e. call plotting functions now like this: `$Graph->drawLineGraph('Serie1');`
  # Replace font names which are no longer part of the package. The new standard font is now `DejaVusSansCondensed` (8 Pixels).
  # Replace function argument values `-1` with `NULL`.

This should take care of most of the standard graphing applications.

The caching system has changed significantly and is now integrated into mtChart. Please refer to the document CachingSystem for implementation information.
